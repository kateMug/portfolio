             <p>This was a re-design exercise for a prototype of the existing Auckland Libraries Website. This was for educational purposes only. The UX Design was completed by Yeojin Choi. I came into the project at a later stage and continued with the code to make the prototype website functional. We had around 3 weeks to complete the project and the final result achieved most of our goals, for such a short timeframe.</p>

                <p>We met with the team at the Auckland City Library who had been working on a re-design of the Auckland Libraries website over the last three years. We discovered that we had come across some of the same design and fucntionality issues as they had done, but resolved them in different ways. One example was how to make different book sizes and shapes fit into a shape that looked good on the website and work across different screen sizes and areas within the site. Yeojin came up with an elegant solution that created a uniform shame for all of the books. Another problem was how to differentiate different kinds of collections within the library such as books, music, adademic collections and DVDs, this was achieved through colour codes for pages.</p>
                 <p>The site was built with sass and pulled into a wordpress framework with php functionality for the search bar to locate books and other items.</p>
